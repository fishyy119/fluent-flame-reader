# Contributor Covenant 3.0 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.


## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Trolling and political attacks** We will not tolerate any kind of trolling behavior in our community, nor will we accept any political attacks against our contributors.
3. **Anti-LGBTQ+ Discrimination** Any type of discrimination against a person based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, such as transphobia, homophobia, queerphobia, etc., will not be tolerated. We take very seriously our commitment to providing a safe space for everyone.
4. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
5. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
6. **Fascist bigotry and similar expressions**. We will not tolerate any promotion of fascist, racist, xenophobic, or highly harmful ideas in our community. Even if this means that some individuals will not wish to contribute to our project, this is our stance and we will not budge from it. Being committed to a safe space means not being weak on this issue.
7. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.

### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources.** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
3. **
3. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

### Restricted behaviors related to the use of AI and similar tools. 

As already stated in the contribution guidelines, we have a stance on AI, and we want to convey this to our entire community as follows: any use of artificial intelligence such as deep fakes, fake news, and simply flooding our spaces is not permitted. Nor do we accept moderators promoting the use of these tools in our spaces, such as using an AI-generated project logo and similar actions.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, **write an email to a maintainer, we will leave these means of contact in a visible place so that you can communicate with us safely.**

Community Moderators take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Community Moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.


## Addressing and Repairing Harm

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community moderators, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact on the community**: Demonstrating a pattern of violating this code of conduct with continued inappropriate behavior, such as: discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, fascist bigotry, abuse against other community members, and ultimately, any behavior that exceeds the established norms and is recurrent enough to justify this measure.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Commitment to severity in sanctioning those contributors with high responsibility and involvement in the project. 

Being part of the project management or having a high level of involvement in development does not exempt you from this code of conduct. If the person who has broken this code of conduct is part of our management or has a high level of involvement, the measures will be severe and there will be no exceptions. 

Anyone involved in this type of behavior does not represent our project, and we will ask them to step down from their responsibilities, apologize, and we will no longer count on their contributions. This means guaranteeing the impartiality and independence of the project; there will be no sacred cows. Those in positions of responsibility are responsible for enforcing this code of conduct. If they break that trust, they will face the consequences, which will be a permanent ban if the offense is serious. If the offense is minor, it will be a temporary ban, but they will be removed from any responsibility in this project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
